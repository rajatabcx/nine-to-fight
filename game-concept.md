## Core Gameplay

Players face workplace scenarios with 2-4 choice responses that affect three stats:

- **Sanity**: Mental health (starts at 100, game over at -100)
- **Money**: Bank balance (starts at -50, representing student debt)
- **Performance**: Company rating (starts at 0, game over at -100)

The goal is to survive as long as possible in the corporate hellscape until you eventually quit, get fired, or have a breakdown. Each decision shapes your path through an endless stream of workplace toxicity.

## Sample Scenarios

- Getting broken setup instructions with no help
- "Simple 2-hour tasks" that require rebuilding entire systems
- Weekend emergencies that ruin personal life
- Passive-aggressive feedback disguised as mentorship
- Impossible deadlines presented as "growth opportunities"

## Endings

Multiple possible endings based on final stats and how long you survived, including burning bridges, silent quitting, becoming toxic yourself, or rare dignified exits. The exact number of endings is still being discovered as the game evolves. Each ending includes a brutal message from founders.

## Cultural Elements

- Modern workplace slang ("circle back", "sync offline", "bandwidth")
- Startup culture toxicity (unpaid overtime as "passion", family rhetoric)
- Indian tech worker experience (student loans, family pressure, corporate exploitation)
- Global remote team dynamics and miscommunication
